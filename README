Problems I had when working on this assignment
**************************************************

* I couldn't figure out how to redirect STDERR of a subshell with piped commands inside of it so I had to redirect STDERR on every command in the pipe inside the subshell
e.g
userid=$($CAT /etc/passwd 2>/dev/null | $GREP "$1" 2>/dev/null | $CUT -d':' -f 3 2>/dev/null)

I know there would be a more succint way of doing this, but I couldn't trivially figure it out


Some of my code is a little too verbose / terse
e.g All the /etc/passwd parsing comes down to different columns only so I should refactor to use a single function and just change the column. However, I ran out of time.

Notes
*****

* I'm pretty happy with how I implemented the menus. It ended up being a lot less code than doing it by hand for all menus and then handling different valid range of choices.
* I'm happy that I learned about ShellCheck. I didn't know about this before. I also installed it on Arch Linux here so I could use it via the cli continuously
